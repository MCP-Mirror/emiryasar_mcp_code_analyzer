## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or later
- Windows (Linux/MacOS support not yet tested)

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/mcp-code-analyzer.git
cd mcp-code-analyzer

# Install dependencies and package

```

## Claude Desktop Integration

### Configuration
1. Access Claude Desktop config:
   ```
   Win + R → %AppData%\Claude\
   ```
2. Create/edit `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "globalShortcut": "Ctrl+Space",
     "mcpServers": {
       "code-analyzer": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": [
           "-m",
           "mcp_code_analyzer",
           "--analyze-paths",
           "C:\\Projects\\path1",
           "C:\\Projects\\path2"
         ],
         "type": "module"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Path Configuration
- Multiple project paths can be specified in configuration
- Additional paths or files can be analyzed via chat messages
- No limit on number of analyzable paths/files
